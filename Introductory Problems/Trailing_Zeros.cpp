// CSES
// Trailing Zeros

/*
Explanation:

Trailing 0s in n! = Count of 5s in prime factors of n!
                  = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ....

Whenever a 5 multiplies with 2, it results 10 which cause a trailing 0 in a factorial
As, count of 2s in prime factors of n! is way more than count of 5s.
So, only count of 5 is considerable.

So the result is the occurrence of 5s among the prime factors 0f n!
